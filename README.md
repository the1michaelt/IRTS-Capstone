IRTS Capstone project

The Integrated Registration Tracking System (IRTS) app draws upon my familiarity with registration tracking systems in Registrar's offices where I worked. 

I used Object Oriented Programming, REST API frameworks, and Relational Database principles to build this app. The tech stack includes Python, Django, MySQL, HTML, CSS Flexbox, and ReactJS. I used Postman to test the Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and Cypress for automated testing of a few common user-behavior sequences.

Technical documentation detailing the technologies supporting the features found in this project is being written at this time.
